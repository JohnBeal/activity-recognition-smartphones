#HCI HAR Tidy Dataset Codebook

Experimental Design and background:


Measurements were carried out on a group of 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years, while they performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone worn on the subject's waist measured 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity at a rate of 50 Hz. The sensor signals were preprocessed with noise filters and sampled in 2.56 s windows with 50% overlap. A series of variables were calcultated for each window. The acceleration signal was decomposed into a body acceleration and gravitational component with a Butterworth low-pass filter (0.3 Hz). Jerk signals were derived from the body line accleration and angular velocity and the magnitudes were calculated using the Euclidean norm. Fast Fourier Transform was applied to some signals to transform from the time to frequency domain. All variables were normalised between -1 â€“ 1, and are therefore dimensionless (without units)   

Raw data:

The preprocessed data of the HCI HAR Dataset was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The dataset had been split into "test" and "train" subsets containing 30% and 70% of the subjects, respectively. The following files from the dataset were used in preparing the tidy dataset:

- 'README.txt'                          Experiment design and general information
- 'features_info.txt':                  Gives information on the variables 
- 'features.txt':                       Lists the codes and corresponding variable names of the 561-feature vector
- 'activity_labels.txt':                Links the activity codes with the corresponding activity names
- 'subject_test/train.txt':             Lists the subject ID code for each row in the test/train datasets    
- 'X_test/train.txt':                   Contains the data from the 561 feature variables 
- 'y_test/train.txt:                    Lists the activity code for each row in the test/train datasets

Data Processing:

1) The subject identifier (Subject ID) and activity code (Activity) for each row were appended to variable data ("X_test/train") from  "subject_test/train" and "y_test/train", respectively. This was done for each of the "test" and "train" datasets.
2) The "test" and "train" datasets were merged by column.
3) The merged dataset was subsetted to include only those variables which contained the strings "mean()" or "std()" in their descriptions - denoting the mean and standard deviation, respectively, calculated from each measurement. This did not include the values derived from the angle() variable of the original dataset (gravityMean,tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean).
4) The activity codes in the Activity column of the dataset were replaced by their descriptions (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTA-IRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
5) The variable names given in the "features.txt" were modified by removing parentheses; removing accidentally doubled occurences of the term "Body"; and substituting the prefixs "t" and "f", denoting time and frequency domain, 
respectively, with the more descriptive versions "Time-" and "Freq-". These variable names were then applied to the dataset.
6) The dataset was ordered by Subject ID and then Activity. An independent, tidy dataset was created by taking the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For each signal was calculated:

mean: mean value
std: standard deviation

Upon transformation to the Tidy Dataset, all observations for each variable for each subject and activity were 
summarised by taking the mean.
